In this file, we conclude the chapter 3, including the basic ideas of the three fundermental data structures: list, stack and queue and its mostly used functions.

List:
·Two implementation of List: array and double link.
·Array implementation (Vector): insert and delete are expensive, in worst case, takes O(n) time [BAD]; findKth operation takes constant time[GOOD];
·Double link implementation: insert and delete takes constant time [GOOD]; findKth operation is expensive, in worst case, takes O(n) time [BAD];
·Functions: size(); clear(); empty(); push_back(); pop_back(); back(); front(); [For both implementations]
            push_front(); pop_front(); [For double link implementation only]
            operator[](int idx); at(int idx); capacity();  resize(); [For array implementation only]

Stack:
·Functions: size(); clear(); empty(); push(); top(); pop();

queue:
·Functions: size(); clear(); empty(); push(); front(); back(); pop();
